# calHacks23
A 36 hour hackathon project, that generates music from emotions detected in text. It uses Hume's emotion detection API and filters on them to get the most expressive human emotions. 
It then processes that input using chat gpt, and generates prompts for a music generating model called [AudioLDM https://huggingface.co/cvssp/audioldm].
